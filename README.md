Holmusk task: Code, Document, Presentation Slides

In the Holmusk file contains the task document, presentation slides, original python scripts which I edited and ran my analysis using the PyCharm IDE.

I have also included a Jupyter Notebook (which I ran before submission) for your convenience! 

Happy reading! Let me know if I can provide anything else.
